# x86OpenGL-Project
This project was one of the final and most challenging projects within my systems programming class, it taught us what OpenGl is for C++ and assembly languages. This taught us how to take in command line arguments, conversion of values to quatanary, and how to plot values on a window. In order to run this project you will need a nasm assembler downloaded as well as OpenGL. I have included a photo of what the outcome is. If all proper parts are downloaded you need to enter make into the command line and then ./lissajou with the proper values shown in the comments of the project.
